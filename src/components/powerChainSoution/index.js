            Lightency is developing a new kind of energy platform and business
            model to empower African communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            600 Million Africans have no access to electricity, and this is a
            huge business opportunity as there is a growing and critical need to
            facilitate broader access to energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lightency brings all energy stakeholders on the same platform to
            lower the cost of electricity while creating new revenue streams for
            prosumers and grid operators.
